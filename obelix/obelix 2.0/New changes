Obelix 2.0 â€” New Changes Compared to Obelix 1.0

1. Steering System Upgrade
   - Replaced the Ackerman steering system used in Obelix 1.0 with a Solid Axle Steering system.
   - This change improves stability, reduces mechanical complexity, and enhances reliability during high-speed navigation and obstacle avoidance.

2. Motor Replacement
   - The original Force-Up 6V 1000 RPM motor has been replaced with Force-Up 6V 625 RPM Carbon Brushed DC Motor.
   - The new motor provides better torque at lower speed, improving precise movement control and reducing mechanical stress.
   - Both motors are compatible with the TB6612FNG driver and maintain differential drive functionality.

3. Power Control Addition
   - Added a toggle switch for motor power, allowing the robot to be safely turned on and off without disconnecting batteries.
